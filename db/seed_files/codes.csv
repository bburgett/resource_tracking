In addition, M&E data are required to ensure accountability to those affected by HIV, in addition to those providing fnancial resources for the HIV response.

 M&E therefore includes expenses related to ascertaining the direction and ultimate achievement of measurement of programme progress, the 
provision of feedback for accountability and quality, and implementation of targeted programmatic evaluation, the implementation and upgrading of information management systems (e.g. other monitoring and health management information systems), the evaluation of prevention, 
care, and treatment efforts. Expenditures on M&E should include the salaries of the staff who implement M&E programmes. "

Also included are sentinel studies, mandatory reporting of cases, and epidemiological analysis. Surveillance implies ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on a disease or health condition. 
Collecting blood samples for the purpose of surveillance is called serosurveillance. Built upon a country’s existing data collection system, second-generation HIV surveillance systems are designed to be adapted and modifed to meet the specifc needs of differing epidemics. For example, HIV surveillance in a country with a predominantly heterosexual epidemic will differ radically from 
surveillance in a country where HIV infection is mostly found among MSM or IDUs. Surveillance for drug resistance is to be recorded under the below category . The surveillance programmes aim to improve the quality and diversity of information sources by developing and implementing standard and rigorous study protocols, using appropriate methods and tools."

HIV drug resistance surveillance is aimed at the epidemiological monitoring of the prevalence and to determine the circulation of resistant viral strains among specifc HIV-positive populations. This provides the number or proportion of HIV positive people in a given population whose HIV is resistant to particular anti-HIV drugs. 
The genotypic antiretroviral resistance test (GART) determines whether a particular strain of HIV has specifc genetic mutations associated with drug resistance. The test analyses a sample of the virus from an individual’s blood to identify any genetic mutations associated with resistance 
to specifc drugs. The phenotypic assay is different from a genotypic assay; it uses an indirect method, and determines by a direct experiment whether a particular strain of HIV is resistant to anti-HIV drugs."

These activities involve support systems for pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical equipment, medical commodities, and supplies to provide care and treatment of people living with HIV and related infections. This includes the design, development, and implementation of improved systems for forecasting, procurement, storage, distribution, and performance monitoring of HIV pharmaceuticals, and of relevant commodities and supplies. This includes actual spending to improve ordering, procurement, shipment, and delivery of the full range of HIV-related pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and other medical commodities.

It covers researchers and professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods, and systems for HIV and in the management of the programmes concerned with HIV and AIDS. Managers and administrators should be included when they spend at least 10% of their time supporting research activities. Researchers include postgraduate students but do not include technicians. Technicians and equivalent staff are people whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience. They participate in R&D by performing scientifc and technical tasks involving the application of concepts and operational methods, normally under the supervision of researchers. This category excludes operations research on health systems aimed to improve health outcomes, including project or programme evaluation.
Research—with the exception of operations research—is not directly linked to the provision of services, and therefore, might be considered to be a satellite component of the expanded response to HIV.

A critical element is the integration into school-based settings of life-skills-education programmes. Skills-based health education and interactive teaching methods have been shown to promote healthy lifestyles and to reduce risky behaviour. The life-skills-based HIV education in schools is a didactic and specifc learning process that teaches young people to understand and assess the individual, social, and environmental factors that raise and lower the risk of HIV transmission. (Teacher training—when measurement is required—should \be measured in accordance with the latest UNICEF guidelines.) To track benefts, the accountant may wish to report expenditure on life-skills activities in both primary and secondary schools as a part of the education system spending (either independent or jointly with the health system).
